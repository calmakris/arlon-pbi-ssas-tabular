  "description": "Determines if the target cost/quantity in the process order is dynamically calculated (1 = Yes, 0 = No). The Power BI system calculates the target cost/quantity for process orders where their variance is not yet official calculated during month-end. Once Finance calculates the variances, this flag should turn to 0 (No).",
